        <p>
            Outer space, commonly shortened to space, 
            is the expanse that exists beyond Earth and its atmosphere and between celestial bodies. 
            Outer space is not completely empty, it is a hard vacuum containing a low density of particles, 
            predominantly a plasma of hydrogen and helium, as well as electromagnetic radiation, 
            magnetic fields, neutrinos, dust, and cosmic rays.

            Geocentric orbit
        </h2>
        <p>
            A spacecraft enters orbit when its centripetal acceleration due to gravity is less than or equal 
            to the centrifugal acceleration due to the horizontal component of its velocity. 
            For a low Earth orbit, this velocity is about 7,800 m/s (28,100 km/h; 17,400 mph);[98] by contrast, 
            the fastest piloted airplane speed ever achieved (excluding speeds achieved by deorbiting spacecraft) 
            was 2,200 m/s (7,900 km/h; 4,900 mph) in 1967 by the North American X-15.

            Big Bang
        </h2>
        <p>
            The Big Bang theory is the prevailing cosmological model explaining the existence 
            of the observable universe from the earliest known periods through its subsequent 
            large-scale evolution. The model describes how the universe expanded from an initial 
            state of high density and temperature, and offers a comprehensive explanation for a 
            broad range of observed phenomena, including the abundance of light elements, the 
            cosmic microwave background (CMB) radiation, and large-scale structure.
